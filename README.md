## Abstract
This visualization was concerned with answering the question of Why the most valuable employees are leaving the organization prematurely. Kaggle was explored for the data concerning the employee working parameters in the industry.

## Cairoâ€™s principles of truth, beauty, function, and insight.
1. Truthfulness - The data is represented as it is. No distortion of any data inputs during plotting is done. The data is properly scaled and can be compared easily. Over-Dramatic representation of data is strictly avoided. 
<br><br>
2. Beauty - The information plotted is clear to understand and uses colors which are easy to eyes. Matplotlib's Seaborn-Colorblind color theme was used to maintain the overall beauty of the graphs.
<br><br>
3. Functionality - The Plots are presented accurately showing the relationship between various parameters.
<br><br>
4. Insightfulness - The Plots are intuitive for ease of understanding and delivering insightful observations.<br><br>
